# DropWatch

A simple web timer to determine the depth or distance an object falls based on time.

Drop* something small and start the timer, when you hear it hit the ground stop the timer and we will calculate the distance for you.

*Make sure there is no one below you when you drop it!

You can also use this to figure out how high something has been thrown, just wait for the item to reach the top off the throw before starting the timer.

Math!

D = (T^2)*16 -- for ft

D = (t^2)*4.9 -- for meter
